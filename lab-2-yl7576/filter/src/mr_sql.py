        Don't forget that we don't care about movies that don't have a genre
        assigned to them.
        
        Parameters:
            -: None
                A value parsed from input and by default it is None because the input is just raw text.
                We do not need to use this parameter.
            line: str
                each single line a file with newline stripped

            Yields:

                key: str
                value: int
                You'll have to design your format for the (key, value) pairs so that
